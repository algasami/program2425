[10] When we use printf(…) function, why the “#include <stdio.h>” is needed and where, in the
LINUX file system, you can locate file stdio.h? And Explain the differences between #include
<my_file.h> and #include “my_file.h”

A: #include <stdio.h> is a way for the compiler to directly copy and paste the content of the header file into where
the macro is. This process is called macro expansion. As for the reason, it's because we need to tell the compiler
the symbol of the printf(...) is the same as the one implemented by the standard I/O source files (.c).
The different between <> and "" is that the former is prefered for global or external headers, while the latter is
for local, relatively-positioned headers. Nowadays, it's mostly personal preference since these two work pretty much
the same.
